# dclstats

A node application that uses the DCL pilot API written by Catherine "Drakona" Darrow to compile weekly stats from the [Descent Champion's Ladder](http://www.descentchampions.org) for the [Self-Destruct Sequence Podcast](http://www.selfdestructsequence.org).

To run, use `node dcl` from the command line.  It will output the file `dcl.htm` in its own directory.

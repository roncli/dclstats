# dclstats

An [Electron](http://electron.atom.io) application that uses the [DCL](http://www.descentchampions.org) pilot API written by Catherine "Drakona" Darrow to compile weekly stats from the [Descent Champion's Ladder](http://www.descentchampions.org) for the [Self-Destruct Sequence Podcast](http://www.selfdestructsequence.org).

To run:
* Make sure you have [node.js](http://node.js) installed.
* Make sure you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.  This should already be installed with node.js.
* From a command line, install Electron globally: `npm install -g electron`
* `cd` to the `app` directory
* Run `electron .` to launch the application.
